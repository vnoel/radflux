data/
	radiometric data (LW/SW/solar angle) and meteorological data (temperature) needed by rfts script should go there.
    The repository already contains sample datasets for this application
    for day data :
        e.g. radflux_1a_1min_v04_20100604_000000_1440.txt for LW/SW data
        e.g. meteoz1_1a_1min_v03_20100604_000000_1440.asc for meteo data
        these files were obtained from the SIRTA database
    for year data :
        e.g. radflux_2007.txt for LW/SW data
    	e.g. MeteoZ1_SIRTA_Z1_1hour2007.txt for meteo data
    	the rfyear data files were produced specifically for this code. They will be replaced in the future by SIRTA reanalyses data.

	CERES EBAF-TOA data needed by rfspace script should go there.
        These data are quite large and cannot be included in the repository, they should be installed manually if not present.
    	e.g. CERES_EBAF-TOA_Ed2.8_Subset_200301-201212.nc   
    	CERES EBAF-TOA data can be obtained from http://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/order_data.php
